# Hello!

You have now successfully initialized the Megakernel Starter Kit from the ThunderKittens Kernelmatic Universe (TKU).

If you'd like to build your example repo, please setup.py with the appropriate environment variables configured: for example, to build for a B200, you might run:
```
TARGET_GPU=BLACKWELL MEGAKERNELS_ROOT=~/path/to/Megakernels THUNDERKITTENS_ROOT=~/path/to/ThunderKittens python setup.py install
```

GLHF!
